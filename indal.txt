📌 4️⃣ Log Forwarding (Send Logs to External Services)
Why? Some companies want to forward logs to their own SIEMs or monitoring tools.

🔹 Features to Add:
✅ Forward logs to Splunk, Datadog, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Prometheus
✅ Support Webhooks to send logs to any 



✅ Recommended Folder Structure for Tests in Go (Best Practices)
Your suggested structure (test/e2e, test/unit, test/integration) is good, but it can be improved based on industry best practices for better maintainability and scalability.

Code review :====>

1. Error Handling Review
- Prompt: "Check if all functions in this Go microservice handle errors appropriately. Ensure that errors are not just logged but also returned to the caller when necessary."

2. Error Propagation
- Prompt: "Review how errors are propagated throughout this microservice. Ensure that the error messages are clear and meaningful for debugging purposes and that they are correctly passed up the call chain."

3. Error Wrapping and Context
- Prompt: "Inspect the error handling in this codebase. Check if the errors are wrapped with context (using `fmt.Errorf` or `errors.Wrap`) to provide more useful information for debugging."

4. Nil Pointer Dereferencing
- Prompt: "Review the code for potential nil pointer dereferencing issues in the microservice. Make sure proper nil checks are in place before accessing any pointers."

5. Null or Empty String Handling
- Prompt: "Check for proper handling of null or empty strings in function parameters and return values. Ensure that any edge cases are covered and prevent potential null pointer exceptions."

6. Logging Consistency
- Prompt: "Review the logging mechanisms in the microservice. Ensure that log levels (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG) are used correctly and consistently. Add log statements where appropriate to aid debugging."

7. Logging Error Details
- Prompt: "Review how errors are logged in the service. Ensure that detailed information such as stack traces, error codes, and request IDs are logged for easy debugging."

8. Duplicate Code Review
- Prompt: "Scan for and identify any areas where code duplication exists within the microservice. Suggest refactoring to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability."

9. Redundant Code Removal
- Prompt: "Check the code for any redundant or unnecessary functions, methods, or variables that can be removed to make the code cleaner and more efficient."

10. Security Vulnerabilities
- Prompt: "Review the codebase for potential security issues like SQL injection, improper input sanitization, and incorrect use of cryptographic functions. Suggest improvements where necessary."

11. Sensitive Data Exposure
- Prompt: "Inspect the code for any places where sensitive data (passwords, API keys, etc.) might be exposed in logs, error messages, or responses. Ensure they are masked or excluded from logs."

12. Data Validation
- Prompt: "Review how user input and API requests are validated. Ensure that all user input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks and invalid data from being processed."

13. Concurrency and Race Conditions
- Prompt: "Examine the code for potential race conditions, especially in functions that access shared resources concurrently. Suggest the use of locks or channels where appropriate."

14. Performance Optimization
- Prompt: "Review the code for any potential performance bottlenecks such as unnecessary loops, inefficient algorithms, or blocking I/O operations. Suggest improvements for optimizing performance."

15. Database Connection Handling
- Prompt: "Inspect how the microservice handles database connections. Ensure that connections are closed properly to avoid potential memory leaks and connection pool exhaustion."

16. HTTP Request/Response Optimization
- Prompt: "Review the HTTP request handling and response generation. Ensure that response status codes are used correctly and that responses are sent with proper headers (e.g., CORS, Content-Type)."

17. API Rate Limiting
- Prompt: "Check for any API rate-limiting mechanisms in place to prevent abuse of the service. Suggest implementing throttling or circuit breakers to protect the system under high load."

18. Dependency Injection
- Prompt: "Inspect how dependencies are managed within the service. Suggest implementing dependency injection if it's not already being used to improve testability and decouple components."
